# `tensorflow_proto`

`tensorflow_proto` is a shortish `build.rs` script that uses `prost-build` to
generate Rust `struct`s that can be used in serialization/deserialization of protocol buffers
wherever tensorflow uses them.

In particular, this is useful in rust/tensorflow library when calling `SessionOptions::set_config`
to configure different parts of tensorflow.

# Usage

A very basic usage example is in tests in `src/lib.rs`, but generally the usage
of the structs generated by `tensorflow_proto` is whatever the API defined by
[`prost`](https://docs.rs/prost) is.

Simply depend on this library. To use a different version of tensorflow, define
`TENSORFLOW_PROTO_SOURCE` to the root of a tensorflow checkout.

This crate is only tested against tensorflow 1.15.2.
