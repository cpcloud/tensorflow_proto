# `tensorflow_proto`

![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/cpcloud/tensorflow_proto/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)
![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tensorflow_proto)

`tensorflow_proto` is a shortish `build.rs` script that uses `prost-build` to
generate Rust `struct`s that can be used in serialization/deserialization of protocol buffers
wherever tensorflow uses them.

In particular, this is useful in rust/tensorflow library when calling `SessionOptions::set_config`
to configure different parts of tensorflow.

**Note**: **This crate is only tested against tensorflow 1.15.2.**

# Usage

Simply depend on the crate.

A very basic usage example is in tests in `src/lib.rs`, but generally the usage
of the structs generated by `tensorflow_proto` is whatever the API defined by
[`prost`](https://docs.rs/prost) is.

To use a different version of tensorflow, define `TENSORFLOW_PROTO_SOURCE` to
the root of a tensorflow checkout.
